# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

The goal of this project is to build a model that classifies the text in tweets as either referring to an actual disaster or not.

This project was developed as a submission to the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/data).
